# frontend-and-backend

![CI](https://github.com/wlsf82/frontend-and-backend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Sample project with basic frontend, running Playwright tests on GitLab.
## Getting Started

## Pre-requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I've used version `v16.14.0` while writing this doc)
- NPM (I've used version `7.22.0` while writing this doc)

**Note:** When installing nodejs, NPM is automatically installed too.


## Install project dependencies

After cloning this project, to install the dev dependencies, access the project root and run `npm install` (or `npm i` for short.)

## Tests

Run `npm test` to run the UI tests.


### Style test scenarios

The “features” files are located on `playwright-e2e-test > tests > *.spec.js`, separated by services.
       
	├── playwright-e2e-test
    |   ├── tests
	│   |    ├── *.spec.js
    |   └──...
	└──...

### Page Objects

Page objects is a common practice and widely used by automated testing projects.

The concept itself is came from front-end testing.

It is located on `playwright-e2e-test > page_objects` directory, and we use “.page” suffix to files.
           
	├── playwright-e2e-test
	│   ├── support
	│   │   └── page_objects
	|   │       │   ├── login.page.js
    |   │       └──...
    |   └──...
	└──...
